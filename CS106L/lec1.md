### How Do We Run C++ Code?
Python is an interpreted language, while C++ is a compiled language.
This means that Python code is executed line by line, while C++ code is translated into machine code before execution.
This fundamental difference has implications for performance, development speed, and ease of debugging.
Compiling allows us to generate more efficient machine code, but compilation can be time-consuming and even make mistakes harder to debug.
